# AsyncDEMO_Net8
A console application demonstrating async programming in C# and .NET 8.  It is loosely based on MS article "Asynchronous programming with async and await", https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/.

The demo application includes a synchronous version of the code and various asynchronous versions.  The various versions are saved side-by-side, rather than as different commits in source control.  When the application runs a menu is displayed, allowing you to choose which version of the code to run.

For more information about the various versions of the code see the wiki [Home](https://github.com/OneEyedSi/AsyncDEMO_Net8/wiki/Home) page.
